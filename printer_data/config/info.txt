Voron 2.4 300mm
- Belts tuned to 110Hz with 150mm between XY idler and front idler centers, by ear comparing to reference tone (tried spectroid, not accurate enough)
- Galileo 2 extruder
- ADXL345 on Nitehawk-SB toolboard (adjusted axes_map to -y,z,-x due to board orientation)
- OMC 17HS19-2004S1 1.8Â° steppers on ABZ
- TMC Autotune enabled on all steppers with default config and sensorless on AB
- Sweep disabled

Did a first tuning pass after reading topics here (checked XY joints screws, equalized belt tension).
Overall pretty satisfied with print quality, no obvious problems.
Cube was printed with MZV with parameters from the results recommendation.

Main question is: is there something blatantly wrong with my setup (or that could be easily improved) ?
